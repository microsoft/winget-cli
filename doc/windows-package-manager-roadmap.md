Note: Many of the features have been implemented in experimental mode. If you execute `winget features` a list of experimental features and their status is displayed. You may modify your settings file with `winget settings` to enable or disable them. The experimental "list" feature is a prerequisite for "upgrade", "uninstall", and other features in development. Once the "list" feature has been fully implemented, the other stable features depending on it will also be migrated from experimental to default.

## GitHub Milestones

We use [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestones) to broadly organize what we intend to work on. Dates are only used for sequencing and do not represent a commitment.

| Milestone | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Backlog](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/2) | Work not yet assigned to a milestone or release |
| [v1.0](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/1) | Work Targeted for v1.0 |
| [v1.1](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/35) | Work Targeted for v1.1 |
| [v.Next](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/34) | Triage for the next Milestone |

## Issue Triage & Prioritization

Incoming issues/asks/etc. are triaged several times a week, labelled appropriately, and assigned to a milestone in priority order:

* P0 (serious crashes, data loss, etc.) issues are scheduled to be dealt with ASAP.
* P1/2 issues/features/asks  assigned to the current or future milestone, or to the [Windows Package Manager v1.0 milestone](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/1) for future assignment, if required to deliver a v1.0 feature.
* Issues/features/asks not on our list of v1.0 features is assigned to the [Windows Package Manager Backlog](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/2) for subsequent triage, prioritization & scheduling.

## v1.0 Scenarios

The following are a list of the key scenarios we're aiming to deliver for Windows Package Manager v1.0.

> ðŸ‘‰ Note: There may be features that don't fit within v1.0, but will be re-assessed and prioritized for a future release, the plan for which will be published in early in 2021. As features become more defined, links to the associated issues will be added.
