## New in v1.29

### `--ignore-unavailable` flag for `install`

Added a new `--ignore-unavailable` flag to the `install` command. When installing multiple packages, this flag allows the operation to continue with the remaining packages instead of failing entirely when one or more packages are not found in the configured sources. This brings the same behavior previously available with `import --ignore-unavailable` to direct multi-package installs.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a crash (`0x8000ffff`) when using `--disable-interactivity` with the Resume experimental feature enabled during install operations.
