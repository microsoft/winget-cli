## GitHub Milestones

We use [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestones) to broadly organize what we intend to work on. Dates are only used for sequencing and do not represent a commitment.

| Milestone | Description |
|    ---    |     ---     |
| [v1.7-Client](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/42) | Work Targeted for v1.7 |
| [v1.8-Client](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/43) | Work Targeted for v1.8 |
| [v.Next-Client](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/34) | Triage for the next Milestone |
| [Backlog-Client](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/2) | Work not yet assigned to a milestone or release |

## Issue Triage & Prioritization

Incoming issues/asks/etc. are triaged several times a week, labelled appropriately, and assigned to a milestone in priority order:

* P0 (serious crashes, data loss, etc.) issues are scheduled to be dealt with ASAP.
* P1/2 issues/features/asks assigned to the current or future milestone.
* Issues/features/asks not on our list of the features of next release is assigned to the [Windows Package Manager Backlog](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/milestone/2) for subsequent triage, prioritization & scheduling.

#### Feature Priorities will be influenced by community feedback on issues.
