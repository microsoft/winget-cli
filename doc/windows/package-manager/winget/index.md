# Use the winget tool to install and manage applications

The **winget** command line tool enables users to discover, install, upgrade, remove and configure applications on Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers. This tool is the client interface to the Windows Package Manager service.

## Install winget

There are several ways to install the **winget** tool:

* The **winget** tool is included in the flight or preview version of [Windows App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1?ocid=9nblggh4nns1_ORSEARCH_Bing&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab). You must install the preview version of **App Installer** to use **winget**. To gain early access, submit your request to the [Windows Package Manager Insiders Program](https://aka.ms/AppInstaller_InsiderProgram). Participating in the flight ring will guarantee you see the latest preview updates.

* Participate in the [Windows Insider Dev Channel](https://insider.windows.com/understand-flighting).

* Install the Windows Desktop App Installer package located on the [Releases page for the winget repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases).

> The **winget** tool is supported on Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763) and above.

## Administrator considerations

Installer behavior can be different depending on whether you are running **winget** with administrator privileges.

* When running **winget** without administrator privileges, some applications may [require elevation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) to install. When the installer runs, Windows will prompt you to [elevate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works). If you choose not to elevate, the application will fail to install.  

* When running **winget** in an Administrator Command Prompt, you will not see [elevation prompts](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) if the application requires it. Always use caution when running your command prompt as an administrator, and only install applications you trust.

## Use winget

After **App Installer** is installed, you can run **winget** by typing 'winget' from a Command Prompt.

One of the most common usage scenarios is to search for and install a favorite tool.

1. To [search](search.md) for a tool, type `winget search <appname>`.
2. After you have confirmed that the tool you want is available, you can [install](install.md) the tool by typing `winget install <appname>`. The **winget** tool will launch the installer and install the application on your PC.

3. In addition to install and search, **winget** provides a number of other commands that enable you to [show details](show.md) on applications, [change sources](source.md), and [validate packages](validate.md). To get a complete list of commands, type: `winget --help`.

## Scripting winget

You can author batch scripts and PowerShell scripts to install multiple applications.

```CMD
@echo off  
Echo Install Powertoys and Terminal  
REM Powertoys  
winget install Microsoft.Powertoys  
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 Echo Powertoys installed successfully.  
REM Terminal  
winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal  
if %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 Echo Terminal installed successfully. %ERRORLEVEL%
```

> When scripted, **winget** will launch the applications in the specified order. When an installer returns success or failure, **winget** will launch the next installer. If an installer launches another process, it is possible that it will return to **winget** prematurely. This will cause **winget** to install the next installer before the previous installer has completed.
