Note: Many of the features have been implemented in experimental mode. If you execute `winget features` a list of experimental features and their status is displayed. You may modify your settings file with `winget settings` to enable or disable them. The experimental "list" feature is a prerequisite for "upgrade", "uninstall", and other features in development. Once the "list" feature has been fully implemented, the other stable features depending on it will also be migrated from experimental to default.
