# WinGet and Desired State Configuration

The `winget configure` command is designed to streamline the process of getting your Windows environment to a desired state. WinGet is leveraging PowerShell Core (not Windows PowerShell) and PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration) to achieve this goal. WinGet is introducing a new YAML formatted file to define the desired state in a declarative manner rather than an imperative mannaer. Our goal is to incorporate this new file and it's syntax into PowerShell DSC v3 in the future.

Many users will be new to "Desired State Configuration" as well as the concept of "Configuration as Code". If you want to understand the basics of what is happening when you run `winget configure <configuration file>` you can take a look at our "PowerShell DSC Primer" below.

## PowerShell DSC Primer

Getting Started with PowerShell DSC in the context of learning the basics of `winget configure`.

This section outlines the process of ensuring you have a PowerShell DSC v2 compatible version of PowerShell. Then it walks you through the process of installing PowerShell Desired State Configuration module. Next it walks you through installing the PowerShell Desired State Resources module. Finally you are given examples to run `Invoke-DscResource` and validate the behavior.

### Ensure you are using PowerShell 7.2 or later

First you need to have PowerShell 7.2 or later. You can run `$PSVersionTable` in PowerShell if you see the following result, you need to switch to a more recent version of PowerShell or install one.

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\denelon> $PSVersionTable

Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSVersion                      5.1.22621.963
PSEdition                      Desktop
PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}
BuildVersion                   10.0.22621.963
CLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000
WSManStackVersion              3.0
PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1
```

To nstall or upgrade PowerShell to the latest version run `winget install Microsoft.PowerShell`.
```PowerShell

*Note: At the time of this writing, the latest version available is 7.3.3.0

Launch PowerShell and run `$PSVersionTable` to verify PSVersion is greater than 7.2:

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\denelon> $PSVersionTable

Name                           Value
----                           -----

WSManStackVersion              3.0
```

### Install the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module

These instructions are taken from [Get started with invoking DSC resources](
https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/getting-started/invoking-dsc-resources?view=dsc-2.0).

Now you will need to install PSDesiredStateConfiguration by running
`Install-Module -Name PSDesiredStateConfiguration -RequiredVersion 2.0.6`

If you see:
```PowerShell
Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its
 InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install
the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
```

In this case, you can respond with "Y" if you trust the PowerShell gallery to install this module.

To verify the command succeeded you can run `Get-Module -listavailable PSDesiredStateConfiguration` and you should see the following output.

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\denelon> Get-Module -listavailable PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    Directory: C:\Users\denelon\Documents\PowerShell\Modules

ModuleType Version    PreRelease Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ---------- ----                                --------- ----------------
Script     2.0.6                 PSDesiredStateConfiguration         Core      {Configuration, New-D…
```

### Install the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module

Run `Install-Module PSDscResources` and you will be prompted with the familiar "Untrusted repository" where you may decide to trust the PowerShell Gallery.

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\denelon> Get-Module -listavailable PSDscResources

    Directory: C:\Users\denelon\Documents\PowerShell\Modules

ModuleType Version    PreRelease Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ---------- ----                                --------- ----------------
Manifest   2.12.0.0              PSDscResources                      Desk
```

### Invoking DSC Resources
The system is now in the proper state to install a PowerShell DSC Resource so you can run `Invoke-DSCResource`.

**Note:** *We can ignore the `Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDscResources` command since we're looking at `winget configure` and not the traditional PowerShell DSC v2 implementation.*

In the example, we are setting a Process scoped environment variable. Before you run through the example you should validate the state of the environment variable outside of the context of PowerShell DSC as a form of independent verification that the desired state is being correctly modified. We will use `$ENV:DSC_EXAMPLE` to check for the presence, absence, and the value for the "DSC_EXAMPLE" environment variable.

An empty response indicates the environment variable is absent. When the variable is present, the value is returned when you run `$ENV:DSC_EXAMPLE`.

```
PS C:\Users\denelon> $ENV:DSC_EXAMPLE
Desired State Configuration
```

These examples are intentionally pedantic to ensure you have an understanding of the different behaviors exhibited when using `Invoke-DscResource`. When you are using DSC Resources to "get", "set", and "test" behaviors, you should independently verify the output. In this case you can run `$ENV:DSC_EXAMPLE` to verify the state of the Process scoped environment variable.

 We will start with the example provided at [Invoking DSC Resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/getting-started/invoking-dsc-resources?view=dsc-2.0#invoking-dsc-resources). 

 To remove the Process scoped environment variable run:
 ```PowerShell
 Invoke-DscResource -Name Environment -Module PSDscResources -Method Test -Property @{
    Name   = 'DSC_EXAMPLE'
    Ensure = 'Present'
    Value  = 'Desired State Configuration'
    Target = 'Process'
}
```
