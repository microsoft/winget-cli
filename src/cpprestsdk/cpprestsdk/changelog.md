* Potential breaking change warning: This release changes the "default" proxy for the WinHTTP backend to go back to WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_DEFAULT_PROXY. See https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk/commit/60e067e71aebebdda5d82955060f5f0821c9df1d for more details. To get automatic WPAD behavior, set the proxy to auto detect.
* macOS with Brew and iOS builds have been disabled and are no longer being tested because our dependency boost for ios project appears to be broken with current releases of XCode as on the Azure Pipelines machines. We are interested in macOS / iOS folks who know what's going on here in contributing a repair to turn this back on.

cpprestsdk (2.10.0)
----------------------

* PR#365 updates our convenience OpenSSL build scripts for Android to use openssl 1.0.2k.
* PR#336 makes the ASIO `http_client` more consistent with the Windows clients by not appending the port when it is default. This improves compatibility with AWS S3.
* PR#251 dramatically improves UTF8/16 conversions from 6s per 1MB to 3s per 1GB (2000x improvement).
* PR#246 enables TLS 1.1 and 1.2 on Windows 7 and Windows 8.
