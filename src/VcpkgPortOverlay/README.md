# Overlay ports

This directory contains an overlay for vcpkg ports, for cases where we need to apply local patches.
In all cases, most of the recipe is taken from the [official vcpkg registry](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg), and we only add a patch.

The whole directory can be re-created with `.\CreatePortOverlay.ps1`
