# Welcome to the Windows Package Manager Client (aka winget) repository

This repository contains the source code for the Window Package Manager Client (aka winget).

The packages available to the client are in the [Community repo](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs).

> The Windows Package Manager project is in Preview. We welcome all feedback, and that feedback might lead to big (maybe even breaking) changes.

## Installing the client

> The client requires Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later at this time.

### Microsoft Store [Recommended]

The client is distributed within the [App Installer](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9nblggh4nns1) package. While this package is pre-installed on Windows, the client will not be made generally available during the Preview period. In order to get automatic updates from the Microsoft Store that contain the client, one must do one of the following:

* Install a [Windows 10 Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) build
* Join the Preview flight ring by sending a request to winget-feedback@microsoft.com

### Manually Update

The same Microsoft Store package will be made available via our [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases). Note that installing this package will give you the WinGet client, but it will not enable automatic updates from the Microsoft Store.

> You may need to install the [Desktop Bridge VC++ v14 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53175) and the associated Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00.UWPDesktop package.
> This should only be necessary on older builds of Windows if you get an error about missing framework packages.

### Build your own

You can also [build the client yourself](#building-the-client). While the client should be perfectly functional, we are not ready to provide full support for clients running outside of the official distribution mechanisms yet. Feel free to file an Issue, but know that it may get lower prioritization.
