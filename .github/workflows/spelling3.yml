# Comment management is handled through a secondary job, for details see:
# https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature%3A-Restricted-Permissions
#
# `jobs.comment-push` runs when a push is made to a repository and the `jobs.spelling` job needs to make a comment
#   (in odd cases, it might actually run just to collapse a comment, but that's fairly rare)
#   it needs `contents: write` in order to add a comment.
#
# `jobs.comment-pr` runs when a pull_request is made to a repository and the `jobs.spelling` job needs to make a comment
#   or collapse a comment (in the case where it had previously made a comment and now no longer needs to show a comment)
#   it needs `pull-requests: write` in order to manipulate those comments.

# Updating pull request branches is managed via comment handling.
# For details, see: https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Update-expect-list
#
# These elements work together to make it happen:
#
# `on.issue_comment`
#   This event listens to comments by users asking to update the metadata.
#
# `jobs.update`
#   This job runs in response to an issue_comment and will push a new commit
#   to update the spelling metadata.
#
# `with.experimental_apply_changes_via_bot`
#   Tells the action to support and generate messages that enable it
#   to make a commit to update the spelling metadata.
#
# `with.ssh_key`
#   In order to trigger workflows when the commit is made, you can provide a
#   secret (typically, a write-enabled github deploy key).
#
#   For background, see: https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Update-with-deploy-key
