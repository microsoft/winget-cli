# See https://www.grammarly.com/blog/cannot-or-can-not/
# > Don't use `can not` when you mean `cannot`. The only time you're likely to see `can not` written as separate words is when the word `can` happens to precede some other phrase that happens to start with `not`.
# > `Can't` is a contraction of `cannot`, and it's best suited for informal writing.
# > In formal writing and where contractions are frowned upon, use `cannot`.
# > It is possible to write `can not`, but you generally find it only as part of some other construction, such as `not only . . . but also.`
# - if you encounter such a case, add a pattern for that case to patterns.txt.
